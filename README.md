### What is TuCSoN?

**TuCSoN** *(**Tu**ple **C**entres **S**pread **o**ver the **N**etwork)* is a *Java library* providing *coordination as a service* to **Java** and **[tuProlog](http://tuprolog.unibo.it)** agents. TuCSoN is a model for the coordination of distributed processes, as well as autonomous, intelligent & mobile agents. TuCSoN exploits tuple centres as its coordination media, which are tuple spaces enhanced with the notion of behaviour specification, thanks to the **[ReSpecT](http://respect.apice.unibo.it)** language.

The TuCSoN coordination technology implements the TuCSoN model as a Java-based distributed middleware, available under [GNU LGPL license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html).
